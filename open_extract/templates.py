CROP_MANAGEMENT = """
# Variety Selection

Choose soybean varieties suited to local climate and soil.
Consider maturity groups, yield potential, and disease resistance.

# Planting Plan

Determine optimal planting dates based on frost-free periods.
Set seeding rates and row spacing for optimal plant density.
Utilize precision planting techniques to ensure uniform emergence.

# Nutrient Management

Conduct soil tests to assess nutrient levels and pH.
Develop a tailored fertilizer program (P, K, micronutrients) based on test results.
Plan for organic amendments or cover crops to enhance soil fertility.

# Irrigation & Water Management

Assess water needs during key growth stages.
Choose efficient irrigation methods (e.g., drip, sprinkler) to conserve water.
Monitor soil moisture and adjust irrigation schedules accordingly.

# Pest & Disease Control

Implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.
Schedule regular field scouting for pests like aphids and diseases such as soybean rust.
Rotate herbicides and apply targeted treatments as needed.

# Crop Rotation & Cultural Practices

Rotate soybeans with cereals or other legumes to maintain soil health.
Use conservation practices like no-till or reduced-till to minimize soil disturbance.
Adjust cultural practices (e.g., planting density, row orientation) to reduce disease risk.
