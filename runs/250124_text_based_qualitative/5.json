    "methodology_summary": "The authors reviewed the literature on early-season pests of soybean in the United States, including bean leaf beetle, grape colaspis, leafhoppers, seedcorn maggot, soybean aphid, threecornered alfalfa hopper, white grubs, and wireworms. They discussed the pest status, management options, and risk factors for each pest.",
    "key_findings": "The authors found that the pest status of these insects varies by region and can be influenced by factors such as planting date, soil type, and weather conditions. They also noted that some pests, such as the soybean aphid, have become more widespread in recent years due to changes in agricultural practices and climate.",
    "insights_on_the_effect_of_plant_date_on_soybean_yield": "The authors found that planting date can impact the risk of infestation by certain pests, such as the threecornered alfalfa hopper. They noted that earlier planted soybeans may be more susceptible to early girdling damage from this pest.",
