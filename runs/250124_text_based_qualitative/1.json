    "methodology_summary": "The study used a randomized complete block design in a split-plot arrangement with four replications to examine the effects of planting date, maturity group, and temperature on soybean seed yield and composition.",
    "key_findings": "1. Planting date and maturity group decisions can greatly affect yield and composition. 2. Temperature had a significant effect on seed yield and composition. 3. Planting date × maturity group should be chosen based on the product’s end use.",
    "insights_on_the_effect_of_plant_date_on_soybean_yield": "The study found that early planting (late April–early May) resulted in higher oil content, while late planting resulted in higher protein content. The combination of early planting and using the longest maturity group (MG 2) had the highest yield, oil, and oleic acid potential across the examined region.",
