    "methodology_summary": "The study used machine learning on US soybean yield data from cultivar trials conducted in 27 states between 2007 and 2016 to examine crop sensitivity to varying in-season weather conditions.",
    "key_findings": "1. **Vapor pressure deficit (Vpd) during 61-90 days after sowing was the most important predictor of soybean yield**. Higher Vpd values were associated with lower yields.\n2. **Sowing 12 days earlier than typical would have resulted in a 10% greater total yield and a cumulative monetary gain of approximately $9 billion** across the US from 2007 to 2016.\n3. **Regional differences in optimal sowing dates**: Earlier sowing dates were beneficial in most states, but later sowing dates were more beneficial in Texas and Mississippi.",
