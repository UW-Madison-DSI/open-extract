    "methodology_summary": "The study used a combination of crop modeling, boundary functions for water productivity, and survey data from 3568 producer fields to estimate yield potential and identify causes of yield gaps in soybean production in the North-Central USA region.",
    "key_findings": "The study found that soybean yield gaps in the North-Central USA region averaged 22% (rainfed) and 13% (irrigated) of the estimated yield potential. Sowing date was identified as a key factor explaining yield variation, with earlier sowing dates resulting in higher yields. Other factors such as tillage, fungicide and/or insecticide application, and artificial drainage also influenced yield, but their impact varied across different technology extrapolation domains (TEDs).",
