    "methodology_summary": "The study used machine learning on US soybean yield data from cultivar trials conducted in 27 states from 2007 to 2016 to examine crop sensitivity to varying in-season weather conditions and identify optimal sowing dates. The analysis included conditional inference regression tree analyses, multiple-site trials, and a machine learning model to predict state-year-specific trial soybean yields across the US based on coordinates and weather variables.",
    "key_findings": "The study found that: 1) Vpd during 61-90 DAS was the most important predictor of soybean yield. 2) Sowing 12 days earlier than what was practiced during this decade (2007-2016) across the US would have resulted in a 10% greater total yield and a cumulative monetary gain of ca. US$9 billion. 3) Southeastern state producers could adjust sowing dates by 30 days earlier than those typically used, resulting in a 377 to 704 kg/ha average yield increase.",
