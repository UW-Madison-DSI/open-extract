    "methodology_summary": "The study used a fractional replication experimental design across two growing seasons (2022 and 2023) to examine the interaction effects of planting dates (PDs) and maturity groups (MGs) on soybean yield in southern Wisconsin.",
    "key_findings": "Optimal soybean yield occurred with early planting, particularly before May 20, with MGs between 1.5 to 2.9 performing best. Delayed planting led to diminished significance in MG selection for yield, but overall yield declined consistently, roughly 20 bu/acre, every 20 days beyond the May 20 PD.",
